## q2

## q3
- If the number of arguments are not equal to 2 the program exits
- Else sorts the given input

## q4
- It contains a parent class 'Triangle' which inherits the default class 'object'
- Triangle class has two variables height and base
- Triangle class has  a function 'area' will return the area of thr triangle
- The child class is 'TriangleChild'
- Using this child class constructor I initialized parent class variables
- I overrided the function 'area' with other definition
- Added another function 'getHeight' which will return the value of the height variable of parent class
- In this way child class can get access to variables and methods of parent class
- Also child class can add extra functionalities such as varibles and functions
